# STA663 Final Project
This repo contains my code and reports for my collaborative final project on implementing and optimizing a Bayeisan Hierachical Clustering algorithm using Python. The final report with code is in the file "STA663_Final_Project_Report.ipynb". The paper for reference is in "Bayeisan Hierachical Clustering.pdf".

Methods used:
* Bayesian hierarchical clustering
* Traditional hierarchical clustering
* K-means clustering
* Cython
